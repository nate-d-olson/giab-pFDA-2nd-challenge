Notes

* Using `git lfs` to track large data files. 
* Installed using `brew install git-lfs`, following gitlab documentation, https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2017/01/30/getting-started-with-git-lfs-tutorial/.

Issues

1. Make sure correct extended csvs are in the `data-raw` directory.
2. Make sure the `Truth_metadata.xlsx` is up to date.
